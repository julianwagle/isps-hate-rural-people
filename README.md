Step Zero: Replace USERNAME and PASSWORD in the aboves files with your own.

Step One: cd to ${Username}/Library/ and run 'mkdir Scripts'

Step Two: place tll.scpt in ${Username}/Library/Scripts/

Step Three: cd to ${Volume}/Library/LaunchDaemons/ and place com.username.tll.plist

Step Four: run ping localhost to verify it all worked. If it didnt, restart your computer and then test again.
